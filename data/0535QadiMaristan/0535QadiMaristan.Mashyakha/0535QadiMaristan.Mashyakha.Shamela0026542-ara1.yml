90#VERS#COMMENT##: pagination corrected by annotator; print edition
    comprises 3 volumes;  Shamela0026542 seems to stretch across vol. 2 and
    part of vol. 3 of the print edition;  nevertheless, the volume numbers
    given in the text should be checked against a physical copy of the work;
    at the beginning of each of the parts 1-5 of vol.2, Shamela0026542
    contains  paratextual material such as riwāyāt (albeit not necessarily
    everything that appears in the underlying print edition has been
    included in the text file); the mashyakha is structured in five parts;
    according to the editor, this structure is attested in historical texts
    that mention the work (see introduction, pp. 297-298);    Line 864 >
    print edition has "akthar munāfiqī ummatī qurrāʾuhā";  Shamela0026542
    had "akthar munāfiqī ummatī qirāʾatan", which has been changed to
    "qurrāʾuhā."
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes.
