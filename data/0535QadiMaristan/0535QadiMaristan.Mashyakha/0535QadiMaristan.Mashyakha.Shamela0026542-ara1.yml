90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: LMN
90#VERS#COMMENT##: pagination corrected by annotator; print edition comprises 3 volumes; 
  Shamela0026542 seems to stretch across vol. 2 and part of vol. 3 of the print edition; 
  nevertheless, the volume numbers given in the text should be checked against a physical copy of the work;
  at the beginning of each of the parts 1-5 of vol.2, Shamela0026542 contains 
  paratextual material such as riwāyāt (albeit not necessarily everything that
  appears in the underlying print edition has been included in the text file);
  the mashyakha is structured in five parts; according to the editor, this structure is attested in historical texts 
  that mention the work (see introduction, pp. 297-298);   
  Line 864 > print edition has "akthar munāfiqī ummatī qurrāʾuhā"; 
  Shamela0026542 had "akthar munāfiqī ummatī qirāʾatan", which has been changed to "qurrāʾuhā."
