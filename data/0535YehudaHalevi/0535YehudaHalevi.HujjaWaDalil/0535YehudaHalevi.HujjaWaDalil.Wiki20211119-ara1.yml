90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digitised text extracted from Wikisource and tagged in
        mARkdown. We have another version of the text in the corpus, but as that's
        uncorrected OCR I thought it would be worthwhile to include this version as
        well. It is unclear which edition this version is based on.
    All paratextual elements
