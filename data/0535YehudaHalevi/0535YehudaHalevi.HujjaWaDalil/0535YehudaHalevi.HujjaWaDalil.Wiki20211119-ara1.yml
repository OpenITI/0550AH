90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digitised text extracted from Wikisource and tagged in
    mARkdown. We have another version of the text in the corpus, but as that's
    uncorrected OCR I thought it would be worthwhile to include this version as
    well. It is unclear which edition this version is based on.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
