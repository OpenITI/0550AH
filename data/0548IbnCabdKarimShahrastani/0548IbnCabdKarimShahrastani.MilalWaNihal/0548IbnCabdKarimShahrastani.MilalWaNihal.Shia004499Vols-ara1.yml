90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Peter Verkinderen
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is the edition by Muḥammad Kīlānī (Dār al-
    Maʿrifa, 1975). JK000344 contains the same version. Both lack all
    punctuation. PV started annotating the JK version, but after a few pages
    decided to  annotate the Shamela version instead, because the quality of
    digitization seemed better.
