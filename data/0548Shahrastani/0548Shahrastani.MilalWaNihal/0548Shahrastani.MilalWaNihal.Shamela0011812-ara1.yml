90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Peter Verkinderen
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The annotated version is the edition by ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz
        Wakīl. This edition was selected because the JK and Shia files  (other
        edition: by Muhammad Kīlānī) does not contain any punctuation. The
        quality of the digitization is generally very good.  The conversion
        script obviously had problems tagging some titles, but PV cleaned these
        errors.  The table on pp. 50-51 was missing; PV added it.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
